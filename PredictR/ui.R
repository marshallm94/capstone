                       The general concept is that whenever the user enters a sequence of words 
                       (referred to as an 'ngram') into the text box, my app takes 
                       the last 5 words in the sequence and searches the data set 
                       for matches. If a match is found, the model outputs the 
                       next word in the data set where the match was found. If a 
                       match is not found, the model goes 'down' one level 
                       and takes the last 4 words in the text box and searches 
                       for matches to that sequence, and returns the next word if 
                       any matches are found. This process continues from 6 word 
                       sequence (sextagram) down to 2 word sequences (bigrams). 
                       If no matches are found to any of the ngrams, the model 
                       outputs the single most commond word(s) in the data set.")
